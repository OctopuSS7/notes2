# Comparatives and Superlatives

## Comparatives

1. Il est plus ... que ... ⟶ He is more ... than ...
2. Il est moins ... que ... ⟶ He is less ... than ...
3. Il est aussi ... que ... ⟶ He is as ... as ...

An adjective or adverb comes after plus, moins or aussi.

The only irregular adjectives in the comparative are **bon ⟶ meilleur** and **mauvais ⟶ piré**.

## Superlatives

2. Il est la moins ... ⟶ He is the least ...

**Le meilleure** and **le pire** can also be used (the best, the worst).
