# Seismic Waves

Earthquakes cause seismic waves. They are detected using seismometers. There are 2 types of seismic wave:

1. Surface waves
    - Cause Earthquakes
    - Love and Rayleigh waves

2. Body waves
    - Provide information about the inside of the Earth
    - P waves and S waves

## P waves

- Longitudinal
- Average speed of 6km/s
- Can travel through solids and liquids

## S waves

- Transverse
- Average speed of 4km/s
- Can only travel through solids

Only P waves can get through the outer core because it is molten. This provides information about the internal structure of the Earth. These 2 types of body waves can be used to locate earthquakes.
