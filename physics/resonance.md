# Resonance

When the driving frequency matches the natural frequency of an oscillation, resonance occurs and the amplitude will be a maximum.

The **Natural Frequency** is the frequency at which an object oscillates at when left alone.



Natural Frequency depends on:

1. Mass
2. Shape
3. Material
4. Length
5. Temperature
6. Pressure

Where is resonance useful?

- Microwaves
    - Water molecules in food have the same natural frequency as a microwave electromagnetic wave, which causes them to vibrate and heat up.
- Swings
- Musical instruments

Where is resonance a nuisance/dangerous?

- Millennium Bridge (resonance of bridge swinging with people walking)
- Glass shattering (resonance of voice with glass)

How can we stop resonance?

- Change something about the system
- Get rid of the driving frequency
