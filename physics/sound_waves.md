# Sound Waves

Sound travels through air at 343m/s, and faster in denser mediums. Sound waves are waves made from the compressions and rarefactions of a medium, that are caused by the vibration of an object. The pitch of a sound wave changes based on the frequency of the vibrations (or oscillations).

The frequency range for human hearing is about 20Hz to 20kHz. As we age, the upper limit usually decreases. The average upper range for adults is 15 - 17kHz.

To measure the speed of sound, you could stand a distance away from someone and clap. They would time between when they see you clap and when they hear it. They you would divide the distance by the time taken for the sound to reach them. You could do this a few times and take the average to make the experiment more accurate.

Pitch is determined by the frequency of the wave, while volume is determined by the amplitude.

Sound waves are longitudinal waves that are caused by vibrations. They are transmitter by areas of higher and lower pressure through a medium. Sound waves travel faster through denser mediums, but lose energy quicker.

Vibration: A backwards and forwards movement that transmits sound.

## Class Questions

Why does sound travel faster in warmer air?

The air particles have more kinetic energy, so there are more collisions.

How far away is a thundercloud if the rumble reaches you 3 seconds after the lightning flash?

$$\begin{align*} V &= \frac{d}{t} \\ 
d &= Vt \\ 
d &= 343 \times 3 \\ 
&\approx 1\text{km} 
\end{align*}$$
