# SQL Statements

**Key Points**
- SQL stand for Structured Query Language
- In SQL, `<>` is the inequality symbol (â‰ )
- In SQL, `*` is a wildcard that shows all fields from a table
- `*` is used in place of `(values to select)`

**EXAMPLE** - An SQL query takes the following form:

```sql
SELECT /*(values to select)*/ FROM /*(table to select from)*/
WHERE /*(first condition)*/
AND /*(second condition)*/
```
