A bit is the smallest storage unit possible on a computer. It has 2 possible values: ON and Off, usually represented by 0 and 1, or True and False.

| 1 nibble         | 4 bits             |
| ---              | ---                |
| 1 byte           | 2 nibbles / 8 bits |
| 1 word           | 2 bytes / 16 bits  |
| 1 kilobyte (KB)  | 1000 bytes         |
| 1 megabyte (MB)  | 1000 kilobytes     |
| 1 gigabyte (GB)  | 1000 megabytes     |
| 1 terabyte (TB)  | 1000 gigabytes     |
| 1 petabyte (PB)  | 1000 terabytes     |
| 1 exabyte (EB)   | 1000 petabytes     |
| 1 zettabyte (ZB) | 1000 exabytes      |

1 kB is 1000 bytes, but 1 kibibyte is 1024 bytes.
- 1 byte is 8 bits.
- 1 kibibyte (KiB) is 1024 bytes.
- 1 mebibyte (MiB) is 1024 kibibytes.
- 1 gibibyte (GiB) is 1024 mebibytes.
- 1 tebibyte (TiB) is 1024 gibibytes.
