# Waves

Waves are a series of oscillations, sometimes transporting energy from place to place. Common examples include: Ultraviolet, Visible Light and Sound Waves. 

There are 2 wave types:
1. A longitudinal wave is one in which the oscillations are parallel to the direction of the travel of the wave.
2. A transverse wave is one on which the oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of the travel of the wave.

All electromagnetic waves are transverse waves, and sound waves are longitudinal waves.

# Symbols

$$\lambda$$: Wavelength

$$V$$: Speed

$$f$$: Frequency

$$T$$: Time period


# Equations

## Wave Equation

Symbol Equation: $$V = f\lambda$$

With Units: $$V \text{ (m/s)} = f \text{ (Hz)} \cdot \lambda \text{ (m)}$$

Word Equation: $$\text{Speed} = \text{Frequency} \times \text{Wavelength}$$

## Frequency Formula

Symbol Equation: $$f = \frac{1}{T}$$

With Units: $$f \text{ (Hz)} = \frac{1}{T \text{ (secs)}}$$

Word Equation: $$\text{Frequency} = \frac{\text{1}}{\text{Wavelength}}$$
